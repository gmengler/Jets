#Jets Project

This project revolves around correctly executing object oriented programming.

This program will print a list of five aircraft while also allowing the user to print the fastest aircraft and the aircraft with the longest range.  In addition, the program can take input from the user to create a new aircraft and then be able to print a list of the aircraft with the aircraft added by the user included.
